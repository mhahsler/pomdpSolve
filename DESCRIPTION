Description: Installs an updated version of 'pomdp-solve', a program to solve Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) using a variety of exact and approximate value iteration algorithms. A convenient R infrastructure is provided in the separate package pomdp. Kaelbling, Littman and Cassandra (1998) <doi:10.1016/S0004-3702(98)00023-X>.
